**🚗 Vehicle Dynamics Simulation Using Python**:



This project is a simulation of basic vehicle longitudinal dynamics, implemented in Python using NumPy.It models how a vehicle accelerates based on parameters such as mass, engine force, drag, rolling resistance, and tractive force.



The simulation is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand, visualize, and modify.



📂 **Project Files:**



Vehicle\_Dynamics.ipynb - Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, formulas, graphs, and simulation logic.

Vehicle\_Dynamics.html -	Exported HTML version for quick viewing without running the notebook. 	



**🎯 Features:**



✔️ Computes vehicle acceleration using physics-based equations



✔️ Implements Runge–Kutta 4 (RK4) for integrating acceleration → velocity → position



✔️ Models:



&nbsp;	Aerodynamic drag



&nbsp;	Rolling resistance



&nbsp;	Engine tractive force



&nbsp;	Net force on the vehicle



✔️ Plots velocity and position vs time



✔️ Clean and beginner-friendly code structure





🧠 **Physics Behind the Simulation**



The net force on the vehicle is:



&nbsp;	 F\_net = F\_engine - F\_rr - F\_drag 



Acceleration: 

&nbsp;	 a = F\_net / m
